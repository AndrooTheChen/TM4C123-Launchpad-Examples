/*
 * 	This template is for the TM4C launchpad MCU, the TM4C123GH6PM.
 * 	The clock is alredy configured for 80Mhz
 * 	It has alredy TivaWare included.
 *
 * 	You can use it for any TM4C123 series MCU if you change the PART define and variant in the configs.
 * 	For TM4C1294 series it needs a modification on the CPU clock setup, SysCtlClockSet
 * can't be used, instead use SysCtlClockFreqSet.
 * 	Also since this is for the launchpad, if you use a different debugger/programmer, change that on the
 * configs too
 *
 *
 * 	It comes alredy with various includes for some driverlib source files.
 *
 * 	It comes with the system tick set up to call a interrupt every 1mS.
 * 	The interrupt increments the variable millis by 1 every time it's called.
 * 	A delay function "Wait" is implemented for making more precise delays than SysCtlDelay.
 *
 * 	This was made not only for my personal use but also for my Tiva Workshop.
